# pi-imps Design

## Problem

Orchestrating multiple isolated agent sessions from a single parent session is useful — parallel research, divide-and-conquer implementation, review alongside building. But existing solutions over-engineer the problem with dashboards, analytics, delegation nag systems, config ceremony, and TUI widgets that belong in separate extensions.

We need a small, composable primitive: summon an agent, get its result, done.

## Principles

1. **Minimal core** — summon, wait, dismiss. Everything else is optional or external.
2. **Low config** — sensible defaults, minimal setup. Configuration lives in `~/.pi/agent/imps.json` (optional). Agent frontmatter is the per-agent configuration surface.
3. **Composable** — other extensions can build on top. Don't bake in observability chrome, custom renderers, or delegation strategies.
4. **No recursion** — imps are leaf workers. Only the parent session spawns imps. Enforced by not loading pi-imps on child sessions — imp tools are never registered, nothing to filter out.
5. **Quiet** — no injected messages, no delegation reminders, no rotating hints. The LLM decides when to delegate based on its system prompt.

## Core API Surface

### Tools (LLM-callable)

#### `summon`

Summon an imp. Returns immediately with a generated name. Non-blocking — the imp runs in the background.

```
summon({
  task: string,           // what the imp should do
  agent?: string,         // named agent, or ephemeral
  model?: string,         // override the agent or parent model
  thinking?: "off" | "minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh",
                           // override the agent or parent thinking level
}) → { name: string }
```

The LLM can call `summon` multiple times (including parallel tool calls) to launch several imps, then collect results with `wait`.

No auto-delivery — the LLM must explicitly call `wait` to collect results. If it never waits, results are visible via `list_imps` but not injected into context.

#### `wait`

Block until imps complete. Streams live progress into the tool call UI via `AgentToolUpdateCallback` — the user sees imp activity (tool calls, turns, status) in real time without extra widgets.

```
wait({
  mode: "all" | "first",  // all: wait for every imp, first: return when any completes
  names?: string[],        // optional: wait for specific imps only (default: all uncollected)
}) → result(s)
```

`all` = Promise.all — wait for everything, return all results.
`first` = Promise.race — return the first imp to complete, others keep running.

When `names` is provided, `wait` targets only those imps. When omitted, it targets all uncollected imps in the current session. Collected imps are removed from the session — subsequent `wait` calls skip them.

`wait` is chainable. After `wait({ mode: "first" })` returns one result, call `wait` again to collect the rest.

Imp failures are returned as results with `failed` status, not thrown exceptions. The LLM sees which imps succeeded and which failed (with error message) and decides how to proceed. If no uncollected imps exist, `wait` returns an empty result.

The result payload is the imp's final assistant message — no summarization or truncation. The delegator controls verbosity through its task description (e.g. "summarize briefly" vs "full analysis").

#### `dismiss`

Dismiss running imp(s). Useful after `wait({ mode: "first" })` to kill remaining imps.

```
dismiss({
  name: string,           // imp name or "all"
})
```

#### `list_imps`

List running and recently completed imps with status and basic stats.

### Scoping

All imp state is session-scoped. `wait`/`dismiss`/`list_imps` only see imps from the current session. Session switch or shutdown dismisses all running imps.

### Agent Discovery

Scan global (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`) and project-local (`.pi/agents/`) directories for agent `.md` files with YAML frontmatter.

### System Prompt

Available agents are injected into the system prompt at session start, matching pi's pattern for skills (XML block).

### Footer

Running imp count in the status line. Minimal — just the count.

### Imp Sessions

Ephemeral, in-memory, no persistence. Model and thinking level resolve independently at summon time:

1. Explicit `summon` override
2. Named agent frontmatter (`model` / `thinking`)
3. Parent session's active model / thinking level

This gives named agents reusable defaults while allowing both named and ephemeral imps to be configured per invocation. Requested models must be available in the parent's model registry. Thinking accepts pi's levels: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`.

### Tools

Configurable at three levels:

- **Settings** (`~/.pi/agent/imps.json`): default tool allowlist and per-agent additive tools
- **Agent frontmatter**: per-agent baseline tools
- **Project config** (`.pi/imps.json`): per-agent additive tools scoped to this project

Resolution at summon time:

1. Determine the **base allowlist**:
   - Named agent with `tools` in frontmatter → use frontmatter tools
   - Named agent without `tools` → use settings `toolAllowlist` (or undefined = all tools)
   - Ephemeral imp → use settings `toolAllowlist` (or undefined = all tools)
2. Compute **additive tools**: union of `agents.<key>.tools` from global `imps.json` and project `.pi/imps.json`, where `<key>` is the agent name (or `"_"` for ephemeral imps)
3. Merge: if base is undefined (all tools), result is undefined (all tools) — additive tools are redundant since all tools are already available. If base is defined, result is `base ∪ additive`.
4. Filter extensions: exclude any that provide no tools in the final allowlist

Absence of frontmatter `tools` means the imp inherits the same tools as the parent session (no filtering applied). An empty list (`tools: []`) means no tools. Additive tools can only expand the base, never restrict it.

If a tool name in the config doesn't correspond to a registered tool, it's silently ignored — the imp simply doesn't get that tool. (Future: surface a warning to the user.)

**Additional extensions** (global `imps.json` only, `additionalExtensions` key) always load on imp sessions regardless of the tool allowlist. Use for permission systems, sandboxing, logging, or other extensions that must not be filtered out. Agent frontmatter and project config cannot override this.

#### Project-level imps.json

Project config lives at `.pi/imps.json` (project root). Both project and global `~/.pi/agent/imps.json` can contain an `agents` object with per-agent tool grants. Their `tools` arrays are unioned (not overridden) — if global grants `["a"]` and project grants `["b"]`, the agent gets both.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "mason": { "tools": ["run_tests", "run_checks"] },
    "sentinel": { "tools": ["run_tests", "run_checks"] }
  }
}
```

This allows projects to grant agents access to project-specific tools (e.g. armory tools like `run_tests`) without modifying global agent definitions.

For ephemeral (unnamed) imps, use the key `"_"`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "_": { "tools": ["run_tests"] }
  }
}
```


### Turn Limit

A global safety net to prevent runaway imps. Default: 30 turns. Configurable in settings, not per-summon.

The imp is unaware of the limit. It works normally until the final turn, when a directive is injected:

> FINAL TURN. Do not start new work. Save any pending changes, commit your progress, and respond with: (1) what you completed, (2) what remains unfinished.

After that turn the session ends. The result returned to the delegator carries a `truncated` status (distinct from `completed` or `failed`), so the LLM knows the imp was cut off and can decide whether to re-delegate the remainder.

The limit is a circuit breaker, not a budget. It exists to catch genuine runaways — loops, wrong approaches, hallucination spirals — not to manage workflow. If an imp hits the limit, the task was too broad or under-specified; decompose it or tighten the prompt rather than raising the limit.
### Names

Generated per imp, recycled when freed.
